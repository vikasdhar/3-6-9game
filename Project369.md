Thirty years ago I wrote the first version of this game. Back then, we had the first generation micro-computers in school. I wondered if a bulky calculator could provide some challenge to us in a simple kid's game. So I wrote some codes and turned the game in as a project in my computer science class. The program worked quite well despite being painfully slow. The graphics were rudimentary, similar to the very, very first computer games. Only black-&-white (or was that green?) lines and texts were used with no animation. The OriginalCodes are posted in case anyone is interested to look at old BASIC codes.
The slow (CPU consuming) part was the computer play routines. The algorithm checked many possible play sequences using nested loops upon nested loops. It was certainly time killing but not quite an enjoyable past time.


Now we port/remake the codes into an Android app. The app is also a means to teach my kid programming skills. Besides being nostalgic, that is why the feel, look, and the game itself are kept simplistic. I imagine it is fun to show off an app that you make on your own cell phone. Then it amazes me to see how a tiny phone performs thousands of times faster than the bulky calculators in the old days.


I would maintain this app as an educational project. Friends and family will find the app in their Google play store. Other beta testers are welcome.
