A simplistic looking board game run on Android phones, this is.
In the 70s, we played it with paper and a pencil. It was a quick game, great for passing time. Basically, two players
tap on squares in the grid to mark it. Align exactly three, six, or nine squares straight to score the points. Obviously the player with the higher score wins.
